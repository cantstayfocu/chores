# chores
Just to use the issue tracker and agile project management of github

# getting started
1. Once you create an account you will want to FORK a new BRANCH of the repository to allow yourself to make changes.

2. These changes will only be made to your BRANCH and will not affect the main repository

3. Once you have made the desired changes, you submit a PULL REQUEST that proposes your changes to be included in the main repository
